## Description
A node application that takes user input to create a website that shows their profile and important information about them. Instead of having to create a website and enter each person's information as you create it, this program makes a simple website using prompts in the node.js command line. It then creates an html page using the entered information. The classes available are 

## Installation
Install the node.js command prompt from the node.js website. When that is completed, use the command line to navigate to the folder that this program is in. Once that is completed, use the command "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" to install inquirer. After this, run "npm i jest" for the software that is used to test runs. Once that is completed, enter "node index.js" to initiate the program.

## Usage
Navigate to the file in the command line, enter "node index.js" and enter anything you want in response to the prompts. This will craete the html file with the answers to your prompts in the sections that correlate with them. The html file will have every employee and all of their attributes.
